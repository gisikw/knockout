Based on the ticket content:

**Title**: "Ensure in_progress tickets sort ahead of open ones"

This ticket is clearly describing **what to build** - a sorting behavior change for tickets. It's requesting that `in_progress` tickets should appear before `open` ones in the list/display order. This is a straightforward feature requirement with a clear specification of the desired behavior.

The ticket header already classifies it as `type: task`, which aligns with this assessment.

```json
{"disposition": "route", "workflow": "task"}
