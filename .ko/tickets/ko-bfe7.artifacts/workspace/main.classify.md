This ticket describes specific code changes to implement:
1. Restructure the projects.yml format
2. Update code that depends on the current file structure
3. Implement auto-migration logic to detect and upgrade old-format configs

The expected output is committed code changes, making this a **task** rather than research or a bug report.
