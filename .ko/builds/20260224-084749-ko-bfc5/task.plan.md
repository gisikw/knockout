The plan is complete and ready for review. It clearly identifies:

1. **Goal**: Unified JSONL logging for both ticket mutations and build transitions
2. **Context**: Detailed analysis of the three existing logging systems and the gap
3. **Approach**: Extend BuildHistoryLogger to capture mutation events alongside build events
4. **Tasks**: Three concrete, ordered implementation steps with verification criteria
5. **Open Questions**: None — the implementation path is unambiguous

The plan is proportional to the ticket (medium-sized feature, medium-length plan) and includes all necessary context for the implementer to understand the existing patterns and constraints.
