The plan is well-structured and ready for implementation. Let me verify the key aspects:

**Completeness Check:**
- ✅ Clear goal: Remove 'create' alias, keep 'add'
- ✅ Identified files: main.go, cmd_create.go, specs, testdata, README.md
- ✅ Ordered tasks: 7 tasks with line numbers and verification steps
- ✅ Approach is clearly explained: routing change only, implementation unchanged

**Feasibility Check:**
- ✅ Context accurately describes both commands calling cmdCreate
- ✅ Approach is sound: remove case statement, update help, update tests/specs
- ✅ File references are reasonable (main.go dispatcher, feature specs, testdata)
- ✅ Verification steps are testable (build, help output, test runs)

**Open Questions:**
- ✅ Plan explicitly states "None" with justification

The plan is detailed, has no open questions, and provides clear verification steps for each task. All necessary files are identified and the approach is straightforward.

```json
{"disposition": "continue"}
