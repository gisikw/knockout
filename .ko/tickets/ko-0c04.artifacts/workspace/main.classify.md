Looking at this ticket, I can clearly determine its classification:

**Ticket Analysis:**
- **Title**: "Ensure ko show [id] --json includes questions json, like ko ls does"
- **Description**: The ticket explicitly requests that a specific command (`ko show [id] --json`) be modified to include questions JSON output, with a reference to existing behavior in another command (`ko ls`)
- **Expected Output**: Code changes to make `ko show [id] --json` match the behavior of `ko ls`

This is a **feature request/enhancement** - it describes exactly what to build (add questions JSON output to `ko show`'s JSON flag) with a clear model for the desired behavior (match what `ko ls` does).

```json
{"disposition": "route", "workflow": "task"}
```
