Looking at this ticket, the user is asking for a **new deliverable to be built**: a simple bash script called `jab.sh` that automates a workflow with four steps (plan, implement, test, validate).

Key indicators this is a **task**:
- Clear description of what to build ("put together a one-shot bash script")
- Specific requirements and workflow steps
- Expected output is a concrete, portable deliverable ("./jab.sh file1 file2 file3")
- User is describing *what to create*, not reporting something broken

```json
{"disposition": "route", "workflow": "task"}
```
