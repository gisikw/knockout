The plan is well-structured and complete. Let me verify the key aspects:

1. **Open Questions**: The plan explicitly states "None. User has confirmed that no migration guide is needed." ✓

2. **Completeness**: The plan has:
   - Clear goal: Update README.md to reflect simplified CLI
   - Identified files: README.md and main.go (for reference)
   - Ordered tasks (5 tasks) with specific line numbers and verification steps ✓
   - Clear approach section explaining the changes

3. **Feasibility**: The plan references:
   - Specific line numbers in README.md and main.go
   - Clear commands to add/remove based on consolidation
   - Verification steps that are testable (e.g., "No `closed` command in the listing")

The plan provides concrete, actionable tasks with precise locations and verification criteria. All tasks are well-defined and the context clearly explains what changes were made in prior consolidation tickets.
