This ticket describes specific code changes to implement: when `ko project set` runs on an already-registered project, the prior entry should be replaced and the default should transfer to the new tag. It's prescriptive about the desired behavior, not diagnostic or investigative. The expected output is committed code that implements this replacement logic.
