The plan is clear, complete, and well-structured:

✅ **Clear goal**: Remove duplicate commands in favor of `ko ls --status=`  
✅ **Files identified**: All 5 locations are mapped with line numbers  
✅ **Ordered tasks**: 6 sequential tasks with specific line ranges and verification steps  
✅ **No open questions**: The plan correctly identifies this as pure deletion  
✅ **Feasibility**: File references and patterns are explicit and verifiable  

This is a straightforward deletion task with no architectural decisions or ambiguity.
