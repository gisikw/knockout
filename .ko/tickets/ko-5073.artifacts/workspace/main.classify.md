Looking at this ticket:

**"ko triage should resolve the project from the ticket id prefix, just like ko close does"**

This is clearly asking for a **code change** - to implement a feature in the `ko triage` command that already exists in `ko close`: resolving the project from the ticket ID prefix. It describes what to build (feature parity between two commands), not what's broken.

```json
{"disposition": "route", "workflow": "task"}
```
