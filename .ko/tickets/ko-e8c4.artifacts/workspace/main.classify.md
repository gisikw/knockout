Looking at this ticket, I need to classify the type of work it requires.

**Analysis:**

The ticket states: "After all CLI consolidation tickets are done, update README.md and ko help output to reflect the simplified command surface."

Key indicators:
- It **describes what to build**: Update documentation and help text
- It specifies **what changes to make**: README.md and ko help output
- It has a **clear deliverable**: Updated documentation reflecting simplified CLI
- It's **conditional** on other tickets being complete, but the work itself is well-defined

This is clearly asking for code/documentation changes, not investigating whether something is broken or asking a research question.
