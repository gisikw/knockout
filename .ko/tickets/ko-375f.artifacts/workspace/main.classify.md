The ticket is quite sparse, but it clearly describes **what to build**: migrating agent harnesses from YAML templates to shell scripts. This is a code change request with a specific goal - replacing one approach with another.

This is a **task** ticket. It specifies:
- A clear objective: migrate agent harnesses
- Source format: YAML templates
- Target format: shell scripts
- Expected output: code changes to implement the migration
