Looking at this ticket:

**"Please update the existing registry to make the 'user' and 'tickler' projects hidden"**

This is a straightforward request to make specific code/configuration changes. It specifies:
- What to update: the existing registry
- What to change: make two specific projects hidden
- Expected outcome: updated registry configuration

This is a **task** — it asks for code changes (updating configuration) with a clear, defined objective. The expected output is committed code.

```json
{"disposition": "route", "workflow": "task"}
