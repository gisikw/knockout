# Sort ready queue by priority then mtime desc instead of lexicographic ID

## Notes

**2026-02-19 02:22:36 UTC:** Replace SortByPriorityThenID with SortByPriorityThenModified. Priority ascending (lower = higher), then ModTime descending (most recently touched first). Two call sites: cmd_list.go:72 and loop.go:53. Keep SortByPriorityThenID around if anything else uses it, but the ready queue and loop should both use the new sort. This means ko loop picks the freshest ready ticket in the highest priority tier — and ko create / ko add-note / ko start all naturally touch the file, so new and actively-worked tickets float up without any extra mechanism.
