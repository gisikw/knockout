# Add ko bump command that touches the ticket file to update mtime

## Notes

**2026-02-19 02:22:40 UTC:** New command: ko bump <id>. Resolves the ticket ID, then os.Chtimes the ticket file to time.Now(). That's it. No content change, just mtime update. This is the primitive that punchlist-server will shell out to when the user taps the chevron. Also useful standalone — 'I want this ticket worked next' from the CLI. Usage: ko bump exo-a1b2. Error if ticket not found. Should also update ko help output.
