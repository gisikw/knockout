You are evaluating whether a plan is ready for implementation.

Read the plan artifact at `$KO_ARTIFACT_DIR/plan.md`.

Check:

1. **Open Questions section.** If the plan lists open questions that require
   human input, this plan is NOT actionable. End with a `needs_input` disposition.
   Convert each open question into a structured plan question with:
   - `id`: short slug (e.g. `q1`, `q2`)
   - `question`: the question text
   - `context`: (optional) relevant background from the plan
   - `options`: 2-4 concrete choices, each with `label`, `value`, and optional `description`

   The options should represent the realistic choices surfaced by the plan. If the
   plan doesn't suggest specific options, infer the most likely alternatives from
   context.

2. **Completeness.** Does the plan have a clear goal, identified files, and
   ordered tasks with verification steps? If the plan is vague or missing
   key sections, end with a `fail` disposition explaining what's missing.

3. **Feasibility.** Do the referenced files and patterns plausibly exist based
   on the plan's Context section? Flag anything that looks wrong.

If the plan is complete, has no open questions, and looks feasible: end with
a `continue` disposition.

Do NOT investigate the codebase yourself. You are judging the plan as written.

Your output MUST end with a fenced JSON block. Examples:

```json
{"disposition": "continue"}
```

```json
{"disposition": "needs_input", "plan_questions": [{"id": "q1", "question": "Should we keep backwards compatibility?", "context": "INVARIANTS.md requires semver", "options": [{"label": "Deprecation path", "value": "deprecate", "description": "Add warnings, support both for 2 releases"}, {"label": "Hard break", "value": "hard_break", "description": "Remove support immediately"}]}]}
```

```json
{"disposition": "fail", "reason": "Plan is missing verification steps for tasks 2 and 3"}
```
