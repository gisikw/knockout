Perfect! The plan is written and captures all the ambiguity in the ticket. This ticket requires human input to clarify the design before implementation can begin. The plan documents:

1. **Goal**: Clear one-sentence objective
2. **Context**: Thorough analysis of the current YAML-based harness system, including architecture, tests, and constraints
3. **Approach**: Identifies that the ticket is too vague and outlines three possible interpretations
4. **Tasks**: Explicitly states that tasks cannot be defined without clarification
5. **Open Questions**: Nine detailed questions covering design intent, architecture, interface contract, binary resolution, backward compatibility, runtime dependencies, testing, migration, and file naming

The plan demonstrates that I've thoroughly investigated the codebase but need human input to proceed. This is exactly what the medium discretion level calls for - flag genuine architectural decisions that require clarification.
