Perfect! I've created a comprehensive plan for renaming `ko reopen` to `ko open`. The plan:

1. **Goal**: Clear one-sentence description of what will be accomplished
2. **Context**: Key files and locations where "reopen" appears in the codebase
3. **Approach**: Simple rename across all occurrences - no complex logic changes needed
4. **Tasks**: 9 ordered tasks covering:
   - Go source code (main.go, cmd_status.go, cmd_serve.go)
   - Tests (cmd_serve_test.go, testdata txtar files)
   - Specs (feature files)
   - Documentation (README.md)
   - Each task includes the file location, what to change, and how to verify

5. **Open Questions**: None - this is a straightforward rename with no ambiguity

The plan is proportional to the ticket size and includes concrete verification steps for each change.
