The ticket file appears to be incomplete - it only contains the frontmatter with no description of what needs to be done. However, based on what's visible:

**Ticket**: "JSONL append on every ticket touch and build step transition"

**Analysis**:
- The title describes a **specific action to implement**: append JSONL data when certain events occur (ticket changes and build step transitions)
- This is a **feature request** or **enhancement** asking for code changes to add this functionality
- The expected output would be committed code that adds this logging/tracking capability

**Classification**: **task**

This is clearly asking for code changes to implement JSONL appending functionality at specific lifecycle points. It's describing what to build, not reporting a problem.
