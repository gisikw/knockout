Looking at this ticket, I need to classify the type of work it represents.

**Ticket Analysis:**

Title: "Migrate agent harnesses from YAML templates to shell scripts"

This ticket is:
- **Descriptive of what to build**: It specifies a concrete migration task - converting existing YAML templates to shell scripts for agent harnesses
- **Action-oriented**: It calls for code changes/refactoring (migration of existing code)
- **Clear scope**: The work involves replacing one implementation with another (YAML → shell scripts)
- **Expected output**: Committed code changes representing the migrated harnesses

This is not asking "can we do this?" (research) or "something is broken" (bug). It's clearly stating what needs to be done - a migration/refactoring task.

**Classification: task**

The ticket describes implementation work to refactor/migrate agent harnesses from one format to another, which is a code change task.
