  - id: q1
    question: "Should we maintain backward compatibility with YAML harnesses during migration?"
    context: "Users may have custom YAML harnesses in ~/.config/knockout/agent-harnesses/. The ticket says 'migrate' but breaking custom harnesses immediately may impact users."
    options:
      - label: "Support both formats (Recommended)"
        value: support_both
        description: "Accept both .sh and .yaml files with .sh taking precedence. Allows gradual migration for users."
      - label: "Clean break"
        value: clean_break
        description: "Replace YAML entirely, communicate breaking change. Simpler to implement, no maintenance overhead."
      - label: "Provide migration tool"
        value: migration_tool
        description: "Automated tool to convert YAML harnesses to shell scripts, then remove YAML support."
  - id: q2
    question: "How should the system handle shell script failures?"
    context: "Scripts may fail with non-zero exit, no output, or malformed output. Harness loading searches multiple locations (project, user, built-in)."
    options:
      - label: "Fall through to next location"
        value: fallthrough
        description: "Continue searching if script fails, similar to file-not-found behavior"
      - label: "Fail immediately"
        value: fail_immediately
        description: "Return error to user, stop searching. Provides clear feedback on problems."
  - id: q3
    question: "Should we add security controls for custom shell harnesses?"
    context: "Shell scripts are more powerful than YAML templates but allow arbitrary code execution. Harnesses are typically trusted code in user's config."
    options:
      - label: "No additional controls"
        value: no_controls
        description: "Assume harnesses are trusted; harness execution already requires user intent"
      - label: "Add validation/warnings"
        value: add_warnings
        description: "Validate script syntax or warn on first use of custom harnesses"
      - label: "Sandbox execution"
        value: sandbox
        description: "Run scripts in restricted environment (more complex, potential compatibility issues)"
  - id: q4
    question: "How should execute permissions be handled for harness scripts?"
    context: "Embedded scripts in the binary and git-tracked scripts may have different permission expectations. Users creating custom harnesses need clear guidance."
    options:
      - label: "Auto-set permissions"
        value: auto_set
        description: "LoadHarness automatically chmod +x scripts. Simpler user experience."
      - label: "Require pre-set permissions"
        value: require_presets
        description: "Fail if script is not executable. More explicit, helps catch user errors."
