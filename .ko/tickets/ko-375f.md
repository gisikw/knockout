# Migrate agent harnesses from YAML templates to shell scripts

## Notes

**2026-02-24 20:03:43 UTC:** ko: FAIL at node 'actionable' — Plan contains open architectural questions that require human input:

1. **Script output format**: How should the shell script communicate the command to Go? Options include: (a) Full command line to stdout with special stdin handling, (b) Args only with Go handling binary resolution, or (c) Structured format like JSON.

2. **Binary resolution**: Should scripts contain their own fallback logic using `command -v`, or should the script output just args with Go resolving the binary from metadata?

3. **Error handling**: Should errors return with script stderr, or should there be a fallback to a default adapter?

4. **Backward compatibility**: Should both YAML and shell harnesses be supported during transition, or should this be a hard cutover removing YAML entirely?

While the plan provides recommendations for each, these are fundamental architectural decisions that should be confirmed by the ticket author before implementation proceeds.
