# Pipeline v2: disposition parsing

Decision nodes return structured JSON in a fenced code block. Runner extracts last fenced JSON block from output, parses against disposition schema (continue, fail, blocked, decompose, route). Replaces first-line ParseStageOutput. Invalid JSON is a retry-eligible failure.
