The plan is clear and actionable. Let me verify its completeness:

**Checklist:**
- ✓ **Goal**: Clear — mark "user" and "tickler" projects as hidden
- ✓ **Context**: Sufficient — specifies registry location, file format, and what the `hidden` property does
- ✓ **Identified Files**: `~/.config/knockout/projects.yml` 
- ✓ **Tasks**: Single, well-defined task with verification steps
- ✓ **No open questions**: Explicitly states "None"
- ✓ **Feasibility**: References match the project context (recent commits show work on projects.yml structure)

The plan is complete and ready for implementation.
