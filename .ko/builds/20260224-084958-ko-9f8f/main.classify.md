The ticket is requesting a feature to support a priority flag (`-p1`) on the `ko create` command. This is a clear request for code changes - specifically, adding a new command-line flag to set priority when creating tickets.

**Classification:** This is a **task** because:
- It describes specific functionality to build (support `-p1` flag on `ko create`)
- The expected output is committed code that implements this feature
- There's no investigation needed - the requirement is explicit and clear
