The plan is fully resolved. All three open questions have been answered by the ticket author:

1. **Triage failures** → log and continue
2. **MaxTickets counting** → triage does not count
3. **Stop signal** → check between tickets, not mid-triage

The 6-task implementation plan is unchanged and ready to execute.
