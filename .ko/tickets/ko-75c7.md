# Deprecate link/unlink commands

Links are non-directional associations between tickets. If they're not
serving a distinct purpose from deps (which are directional), remove them.

Remove `ko link` and `ko unlink` commands. Remove `links:` from ticket
frontmatter. Clean up any code that reads/writes links.
