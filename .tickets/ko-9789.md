# Pipeline v2: ticket workspace

Runner creates build-scoped workspace dir at .ko/builds/<ts>-<id>/workspace/, exposed as $KO_TICKET_WORKSPACE env var. Stage outputs tee'd to <workflow>.<stage>.md. Replaces single-stage-back output threading. Persists across all stages and workflow transitions within a build.
