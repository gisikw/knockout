Evaluating the plan:

**Completeness Check:**
- ✅ Clear goal: Rename `ko reopen` to `ko open`
- ✅ Context provided: Explains why (status name is "open", not "reopen")
- ✅ All relevant files identified with line numbers
- ✅ Ordered tasks with specific file locations
- ✅ Verification steps for each task (build, tests, help output)
- ✅ Covers code, tests, specs, and documentation

**Feasibility Check:**
- ✅ File locations plausible (main.go, cmd_status.go, cmd_serve.go, tests, specs, README)
- ✅ Changes are straightforward string replacements
- ✅ Function rename is consistent throughout
- ✅ All test locations identified and included

**Open Questions:**
- No open questions listed, and none are needed—this is indeed a straightforward rename.

The plan is complete, well-scoped, and ready for implementation. All necessary files are identified, tasks are clearly ordered, and verification steps are appropriate.
