# Could you put together a one-shot bash script that is STUPID simple, but basically does this workflow in miniature? jab.sh maybe. Maybe just three steps - a plan, an implement, a test, and a validate? (Okay, four steps, but test could be bash). Goal would be like, a single deliverable folks could take and run ./jab.sh file1 file2 file3, and it would loop through all the files, run the LLM or bash steps; the body of the prompts could be in the script, just a trivially portable thing. To be able to hand to someone and say "here; it's not perfect, go make it yours"
