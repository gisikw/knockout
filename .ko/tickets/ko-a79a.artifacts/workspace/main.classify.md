Looking at this ticket, I need to classify what kind of work it requires.

The ticket asks: "Should we add behave, add the python and package dependency to flake.nix, and make the specs part of our test suite?"

This is phrased as a question ("Should we...?") that requires investigation and a decision before implementation. The ticket is asking whether these changes are appropriate and what they would entail, rather than asserting that something is broken or providing clear implementation instructions.

The expected output here is findings and a decision about whether to proceed, not committed code. If the answer is "yes," then separate task tickets would follow for the actual implementation.
