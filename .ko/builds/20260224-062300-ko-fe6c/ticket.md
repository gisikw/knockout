## Notes

**2026-02-24 05:54:10 UTC:** ko: FAIL at node 'review' — Implementation stage failed to make any code changes. The agent reported being blocked on write permissions and made no modifications to cmd_note.go, specs, or tests. All 4 planned tasks remain incomplete. The ticket should be rerun or the permission system needs to be addressed before implementation can proceed.
