# Actionable gate: decision node between plan and implement

Write the `actionable.md` prompt for the decision node between plan and implement.

The plan node (ko-f3e2) always produces a plan artifact. The actionable node
reads that artifact and decides: is this plan actionable, or does it have open
questions that need human input?

Dispositions:
- `continue`: Plan is actionable, proceed to implement
- `fail`: Plan has open questions. The failure reason should list the specific
  questions/decisions needed from a human. These become the overnight queue
  annotations — "this ticket needs X from you."

This is deliberately cheap — it's reading an artifact, not crawling the codebase.
Could potentially run on haiku.

On retry (after human answers questions): the plan node re-runs first, sees its
prior artifact + new ticket context, updates the plan, then actionable re-evaluates.

Depends on: ko-8a7c (artifact directory), ko-f3e2 (plan node)
