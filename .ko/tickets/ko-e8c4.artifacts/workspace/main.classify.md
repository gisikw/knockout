Looking at this ticket, I need to classify what kind of work it requires.

The ticket is asking me to:
1. Update README.md 
2. Update ko help output
3. Reflect the simplified command surface from completed CLI consolidation tickets

This is clearly **requesting code changes** - specifically documentation updates. The ticket describes what needs to be built (updated documentation for a simplified CLI), not what's broken or needs investigation. The decision note confirms the scope: "Only update command listings; users can infer changes from the new command surface and error messages"

```json
{"disposition": "route", "workflow": "task"}
```
