    question: "When re-registering a project under a different tag, should the default be transferred to the new tag or cleared?"
    context: "When evicting a stale tag entry for the same path, if the evicted tag was the default (reg.Default), the plan proposes transferring it to the new tag. The alternative is clearing it entirely (reg.Default = '')."
    options:
      - label: "Transfer default to new tag (Recommended)"
        value: transfer_default
        description: "Set reg.Default to the new tag. More ergonomic since the user is explicitly re-tagging the project."
      - label: "Clear default to empty"
        value: clear_default
        description: "Leave reg.Default empty. More conservative, avoids implicit default assignment."

# If `ko project set` is run on a project that already has an entry in the registry, that prior entry should be replaced. The project shouldn't answer to multiple project tags
