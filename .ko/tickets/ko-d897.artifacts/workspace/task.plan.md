Perfect! I've updated the plan to reflect the clarified decision from the ticket notes. The key changes from the prior plan are:

1. **Strict priority implemented** - Changed from merge behavior to strict priority: stdin > second positional arg > -d flag
2. **Only highest-priority source used** - When a higher-priority source has content, lower-priority sources are ignored
3. **Clearer task descriptions** - Updated Task 2 to explicitly handle the priority logic
4. **Removed "Open Questions" section** - Since the decision has been made, there are no remaining open questions

The plan now accurately reflects the requirement for strict priority rather than merging all description sources together.
