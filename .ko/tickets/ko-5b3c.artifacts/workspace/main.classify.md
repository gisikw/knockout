Looking at this ticket, I can identify the following:

**Ticket description**: "Add support for a 'hidden' flag in projects (which can be set similarly to the --default flag). If a project is hidden, it should be excluded from ko project ls"

**Key observations**:
- Uses "Add support for" - explicitly requesting a new feature
- Provides implementation guidance: "similarly to the --default flag"
- Specifies expected behavior: hidden projects are excluded from `ko project ls`
- Describes WHAT TO BUILD, not what's broken

This is a clear **task** - the ticket describes a feature to implement with well-defined requirements and expected behavior.
