# Update README and help text for CLI simplification

After all CLI consolidation tickets are done, update README.md and ko help output to reflect the simplified command surface.

## Notes

**2026-02-25 22:56:33 UTC:** Question: Should we add a migration guide or deprecation note to the README explaining the removed commands?
Answer: No migration guide
Only update command listings; users can infer changes from the new command surface and error messages
