Looking at this ticket, I can classify it based on the content:

**Analysis:**
- The ticket clearly describes **what to build**: two new flags (`--limit` and `--json`) for the `ko ls` command
- It specifies the expected behavior and output format
- It references existing behavior to match (`ko query` schema)
- This is a feature addition request with clear implementation goals

This is straightforward implementation work, not a question or investigation, and not reporting a broken feature.
