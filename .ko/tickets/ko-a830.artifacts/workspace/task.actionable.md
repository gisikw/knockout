Excellent. The plan is complete, accurate, and feasible:

✅ **Goal**: Clear and specific - remove the `ko clear` command entirely
✅ **Context**: Accurately identifies all locations where the command appears
✅ **Files referenced**: All files exist and line numbers are accurate
✅ **No tests**: Verified that no tests exist for this command
✅ **Tasks**: Well-ordered with clear verification steps
✅ **Open Questions**: Correctly states there are none

The plan is actionable and ready for implementation.
