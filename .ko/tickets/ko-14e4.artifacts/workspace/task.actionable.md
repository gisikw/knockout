The plan is complete and ready for implementation:

- **No open questions**: All three questions are explicitly resolved (triage failure handling, ticket counting, and stop signal timing).
- **Clear structure**: Goal, context, approach, and 6 ordered tasks with specific files and verification steps.
- **Feasible references**: All cited files, functions, and patterns are grounded in the context section and existing codebase references (txtar tests, feature specs, file sizes within limits).
- **Testable**: Each task includes concrete verification steps (`go test ./...`, specific test names, feature scenarios).
