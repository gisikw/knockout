# Support granular tool permissions in pipeline config

## Notes

**2026-02-24 08:47:49 UTC:** ko: FAIL at node 'actionable' — Unresolved architectural decision in Open Questions #1: 'Merge vs Override Semantics: Should allowed_tools at node level completely replace the parent lists, or should it merge (union)?' The plan recommends merge semantics but explicitly requests a decision before implementation.
