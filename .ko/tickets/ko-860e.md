# Consolidate block/questions/answer into ko triage

Replace three commands with one:

ko triage <id>                          # show triage state (questions, block status)
ko triage <id> --questions '[...]'      # block with plan questions
ko triage <id> --answers '{...}'        # answer questions, auto-unblock when all answered
ko triage <id> 'block reason'           # block with reason text

Replaces: ko block --questions, ko questions, ko answer

Open question: should bare 'ko block <id>' (no reason) still be supported, or require a reason? Leaning toward requiring a reason — if you're blocking, say why.

## Notes

**2026-02-25 20:09:47 UTC:** Revised design:

ko triage <id>                           # show block reason + open questions
ko triage <id> --block ['reason']        # set to blocked, optional reason added as note
ko triage <id> --questions 'json'        # add questions, implicitly blocks
ko triage <id> --answers 'json'          # answer questions, implicitly opens when all answered

Status transitions are implicit:
- --questions → status=blocked (you're saying 'this needs answers before it can proceed')
- --answers that resolve all questions → status=open (unblocked)
- --block → status=blocked (explicit block with optional reason)

Replaces: ko block, ko block --questions, ko questions, ko answer

**2026-02-25 21:41:32 UTC:** Question: Should this be a breaking change by removing the old commands entirely, or maintain backward compatibility?
Answer: Remove entirely (Recommended)
Delete old commands as specified in ticket, breaking existing scripts

**2026-02-25 21:41:32 UTC:** Question: What format should bare `ko triage <id>` use to display block reason and open questions?
Answer: Human-readable with JSON (Recommended)
Show block reason as text, followed by JSON array of questions for machine-readability

**2026-02-25 21:41:32 UTC:** Question: What note format should `ko triage <id> --block <reason>` use when saving the block reason?
Answer: Parseable format (Recommended)
Use 'ko: BLOCKED — {reason}' format so ExtractBlockReason can extract it consistently

**2026-02-25 22:35:05 UTC:** ko: SUCCEED
